    Hey! I am Syed Mustassim.
    Here is a little tanka for you;
    Gone are my old familiar friends
    All those I used to know 
    Yet deep in this garden 
    Grow the same old palm trees
    That I knew long ago

    Also, I have worked on a CLI project. Further info to follow. 

    Few Japanese favourite books: Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, The Woman in the Dunes by Kobo Abe
